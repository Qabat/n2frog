# SHG FROG software for measuring nonlinear refractive index

This program when finished is supposed to get measured SHG FROG spectrogram and experimental parameters as input and give n2 with error as output.

Main part of this software (FROG algorithm) is based on:

- Adam Wyatt's program, available here: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/16235-frequency-resolved-optical-gating--frog-
- Steven Byrnes' program (which is direct update of the first one), available here: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/34986-frequency-resolved-optical-gating--frog-
- Kenneth DeLong's program, available here: https://github.com/kenwdelong/frog
