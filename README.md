# SHG FROG PCGPA software for measuring nonlinear refractive index

This program when finished is supposed to get measured SHG FROG spectrogram and experimental parameters as input and give n2 with error as output.

MATLAB version will be developed first and when it will be working properly, it will be rewritten in Python to be fully open source.

Main part of this software (FROG algorithm) is based on:

- Adam Wyatt's program, available here: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/16235-frequency-resolved-optical-gating--frog-
- Steven Byrnes' program (which is direct update of the first one), available here: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/34986-frequency-resolved-optical-gating--frog-
- Kenneth DeLong's program, available here: https://github.com/kenwdelong/frog
- many publications by Rick Trebino, Daniel Kane, Kenneth DeLong, Ziyang Wang et al.
