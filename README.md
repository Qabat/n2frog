# SHG FROG PCGPA software for measuring nonlinear refractive index

This program calculates n2 of a material via fitting the phase of the pulse propagated through the sample to its intensity.
Only-FROG version is also available and will be rewritten in Python soonTM.

FROG algorithm is based on:

- Adam Wyatt's program, available here: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/16235-frequency-resolved-optical-gating--frog-
- Steven Byrnes' program (which is direct update of the first one), available here: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/34986-frequency-resolved-optical-gating--frog-
- Kenneth DeLong's program, available here: https://github.com/kenwdelong/frog
- many publications by Rick Trebino, Daniel Kane, Kenneth DeLong, Ziyang Wang and others

Fitting procedure for recovering n2 from SPM-induced phase is based on my engineering thesis and soon to be published paper.
